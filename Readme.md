# Bang head here

## For moments of frustration

### Have you ever...

- [x] Inherited SASS/LESS that was uneccessarily complex
- [x] Cursed at Unit Tests that need unit testing
- [x] Wondered why a project has NPM and GULP and GRUNT and BOWER
- [x] Had a client that wanted a Facebook clone turned around in a month

This is the perfect thing for you

Just clone this repo and run `npm install && npm start`
